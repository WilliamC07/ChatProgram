Finished writing proposal

Finished changing terminal to raw mode

Can build strings off of what the user types
16:24
Can parse what the user typed in
20:28
Updating the terminal has its own thread. Can display what the user is typing now to terminal.

Used a linkedlist for keeping track of chat messages

15:49

Write to buffer and flush the buffer rather than multiple printf so we can show cursor position when typing a message.
13:29
Quality of life changes: Pressing enter will clear what you are typing, '=' padding for what you are typing and chat log.
17:58
Fixed backspacing on empty text segfaulting

Refractor code (improved variable named, divided up functions into separate c files).
Typing is no longer laggy (loops doesn't spam clear screen and print, it listens for changes first then update if there are changes).
Threw out idea of viewing HELP/INFO -- too complicated to implement.
02:54
Can now scroll up and down (cannot scroll above first message and hide those below -- basically weird scrolling that hides
text underneath bug is fixed). If you hold down up arrow key, it will seg fault. If you were to press up arrow key many times
it will not seg fault. I do not know how to fix this.

Can now exit the chat
Stopped using a thread to update the screen. When any changes are done by any thread, it should call a function that
will print to the screen. This solves the bug detailed on 12/26 02:54.
